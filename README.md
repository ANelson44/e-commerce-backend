# Object Relational Mapping ORM E-Commerce Back End

## Description
  This back-end database is set up for e-commerce websites using Express.js API and Sequalize to connect to the MySQL database. The back-end database allows users to create a development database, seed it with test data, and sync Sequalize models to MySQL database. User's have the ability to use GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE routes to manipulate the data.

## Usage
  1) Open the "intergrated terminal" and run 'npm i' and update '.env'
  2) Using MySQL shell commands, source the schema.sql file
  3) Run 'npm run seed' to seed the database with the test data. Then run 'npm start' or 'nodemon' to  start the server
  4) Use Insomnia at http://localhost:3001 with the various end points to run GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE routes.
